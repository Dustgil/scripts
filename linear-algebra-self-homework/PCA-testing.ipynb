    "Principal component analysis is a statistical tool to help determine the dimensions of a dataset along which the largest variance occurs, and therefore reduce the relevant dimensionality by a significant margin. Here I am performing the technique on a randomized set of points in R^2 that has then been scaled in both the x and y directions, shifted from the origin by some amount, and rotated through an angle. The data will thus take on the appearance of an ellipse in R^2. If The technique works correctly, PCA will determine the directions of largest variance in the dataset. These should be the major and minor axes of the ellipse. \n",
